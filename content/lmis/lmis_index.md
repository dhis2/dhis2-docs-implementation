# DHIS2 Logistics Toolkit #

The availability of data is essential to ensure effect supply chain management and improving the quality of health services which it supports. The DHIS2 Logistics toolkit focuses on *last-mile* logistics features to support data entry, storage and analysis. They cover areas such as stock management, but also cold chain and equipment management. These can be deployed as part of the integrated HMIS solution or as a standalone. To make best use of the data, it is also recommended to link it to a central eLMIS or ERP that supports national supply chain management. 

## Overview of the Features ##

Following is a list of the logistics tools that can be configured natively in your DHIS2 instance:

1. Monthly Stock Reporting (MSR) - Aggregate data report configuration
2. Real-Time Stock (RTS) - Transactional stock management tool for Android Capture
3. Biomedical Equipment Lifecycle management (BLC) - Asset register and workflow support
4. Cold Chain Equipment management (CCE) - Asset register and workflow support specialized for cold chain
5. GS1-DataMatrix cod (GS1) - Read and parse GS1 codes
6. Health Care Product Catalogue (HPC) - Catalogue with item attribute information

8. Consignment Receipt Acknowledgement (CRA) - Confirmation of shipment received in DHIS2 sites
9. Data Quality & Data Use - Methods to improve the quality of collected data and utlization of data for decision making and reporting

## Recommendations for Use ##

It is recommended to conduct a use case assessment to ensure that these tools are well integrated in the LMIS, and the broader HIS, landscape. Many of the advantages of using these tools are predicated on leveraging existing DHIS2 implementations, staff, infrastructure, experience and other resources that would otherwise create a greater barrier for adoption of a standalone solution. That being said, these tools alone cannot support the entirety of the supply chain management information needs for a full country and any digital system being implemented should be considered within the broader HIS context.
